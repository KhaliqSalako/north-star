# Anri's Journal

   We completed all we set out to do. In an effort to stop constant red following us like an omen we consulted the wise-man and wise-woman. With much effort and ritual it was found to be hopeless. But then in a trance I had received another vision remembering an omen of the last voyage and placed the keys in the right spot to cleanse the red away from our ship.

   Our voyage is nearing its final hour. The dreams still haunt me but we have acquired the coveted ambergris after capturing the great whale together, all four of us. We have just been processing what we have, polishing our product to sell at the markets. Much rum was drank and merryiment was made. 

3/7/2022
   The great whale is on it's last legs I am sure of it. My co-captain, Khaliq managed to also break new waters in Event Detail page. We consulted our other seefaring peers gave us pointers for the hunt.

3/6/2022
  Itinerary was a formidable beast that had been plaguing our travels. A great sinister whale that seemed to take every hook and harpoon we thrown to tame the goliath. We consulted the wise-man on the top of mount 42 and showed us the path to traverse these treacherous waters.

   Me and my co capitain Khaliq have been sailing smoothly across the frontend sea. We captured sidebar with minimal effort and basked in its glorious spoils upon on browser. But then our sacrosanct map turned against us causing our ship to sink till we appeased it gold and bugfixes. 

3/2/2022
   Our seige on the google map api seems to coming te the final hour. We have tunnelled mostly under it's walls but were unable to make a complete breakthrough. Splitting off into pairs again. Me and Khaliq worked to put a guard at the gate of the Return preventing passage until they had the golden hook of isEventLoaded.

   We decimated our milestones today, smashing bugs in a wild berserker rage. With the pests defeated we moved on to integrate google search functionality. Braden of House Towns proved a competant ally on this campaign.

2/28/2022
   Working with the Town today we received many fortunate successes. We created our blessed forms that will become the foundation for our project to come. In my wisdom I showed how to conditionally render the dropdown in a elegant and scalable way. I did not tell the other's I saw the code in a dream the night before. They would not understand.


2/27/2022
   Pairs again today. Working with Loui the IV of the kingdom of Paparella. Going deep into the the debugging abyss under a mountain of stack overflow pages. Or efforts seemed fruitless and we lost morale. Luckily the other pair seemed to fair better. 

2/24/2022
   We have started to split into pairs. Today I worked with louis. We spent time working on a kind of nav side bar for the trips. It was a pained struggle that almost cost me my sanity. I still hear whispers in my brain, and red console behind my eyelids. But afterwords their was joyous celebration and much jubilation that made it all worth it. 

2/23/2022
   Frontend authentication is back and badder than ever. We eventually slayed that beast and got login, logout-- all the good stuff working. Then came the trip list and we struggled to send the token or some kind of cookie to the back end. 

2/22/2022
   Finishing the backend we started to work on the front end authentication, this proved to difficult. Trying to understand what we had to do was confusing and we didn't really understand what those functions were doing. We did make some progress an the front end.

2/21/2022
   After getting some help we started to make significant progress on the backend part of the code. We tested all our endpoint in swagger we proved to be pretty easy. We are very close to finishing our endpoints.

2/16/2022
   Making these backend endpoints with fast api hav proven difficult. We were thinking of getting help tomorrow.

2/15/2022
 We spent a lot of time and made a lot of progress setting up google map api calls. It was difficult to understand the syntax they wanted but then progress became much faster.

2/14/2023
   Started authentication lead to some roadblocks and we spent a significant amount of time. This has been a challenging part of the project for our group. Despite this we were able to successfully set up our authentication with the database. 

2/13/2023
   We worked on our docker files and our requirements.txt. We started the authentication. We ran into an issue with getting the account endpoints to appear on the website. We analyzed some example code that we had for mongo project. Ultimately it was not very helpful. We were thinking about asking Riley tomorrow.We talked about if we are going to use a relational database or an non relational one. We ended up choosing Mongo for our DB of choice for the project since it is going to be a small project with little metadata needed. We also spent some time today Reviewing API documentation, as well as watching the first set of videos in Learn that talk about FastAPI.

2/10/2023

   Today we finished our API endpoints. We alo reviewed some documentation. not much was done. 

 2/9/2023
    Today we finished up doing the wire frame work for our project. Today we worked on our API endpoints. We were able to finish all of the end points for the most part. This involved drawing out web-pages of our project. We also made our markup files were we drew out exactly what data we need and expect to get from each endpoint.
