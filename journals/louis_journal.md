   - We finalized the project today by working through a series of minor bug fixes. We got the photo carousel working on the login page and worked through the linter. The code us fully ready to be graded with all bugs fixed and no red in the console. All features are working well.Test.

1. 3/8/2022

   - Mostly finished with the project but just continued cleaning up a few errors, and fine tuning the styling. We are mostly working on adding photos to the website and formatting them on the pages. The project is almost complete and we should be done by tomorrow.

1. 3/7/2022

   - We are at the point in the project where we are working on styling and bug fixing. We set up the forms the way we wanted to and were working on devising containers for our main page. We also discussed adding some error handling to the code which we hope to implement tomorrow.

1. 3/6/2022

   - At this point, the functionality on our website is essentially complete. We broke up into pairs today and Braden and I finished up the signup and login modals. The rest of the day was spent working on styling. We got the main cards styled in a nice manner and we also got hte background for the main page and trips page working.

1. 3/3/2022

   - Today we had a tough day because we could not get our nav bar working. We also could not get our login modal working. We spent the whole day on these and did not make any progress. It was very frustrating. Luckily we came up with a plan that could potentially get us through this difficult challenge on monday.

1. 3/2/2022

   - Today we made a good amount of progress by first finishing up out Google API map views for both the itinerary page with multiple pins and the events page with one pin for each event. We then split up and Braden and I set up the Trip cards on the main home page. We got the photos and functionality working for the cards and it looks great.

   - Today we had another very productive day of coding. We got our entire external API working with Google. We integrated Google search into our front end, and also integrated a map with our search results that displays the locations of the events for our customers. We added some navigation to the website and also added photos based on the location search.

1. 2/28/2022

   - We had a good day today as far as productivity goes. We split up into teams and Kalique and I were able to build out Events details and edit events pages. The other team members build out itinerary and create events. We got the majority of the pages list views, detail views, and forms completed today. The skeleton of the project is complete. we also got front end links working between all of these pages. It is now in good working order.

1. 2/27/2022

   - We started the day breaking up into groups of 2 to try to cover more ground on the project. Anri and I continuted working on the navigation sidebar but ran into bugs because we were mapping subfunctions. This resulted in major issues that we were unable to solve. We later met back up with the whole group to work on the create trips page. This was another monumental lift that took us a solid 2 hours to figure out be we finally got it working.

1. 2/24/2022

   - Today we started working on the Trip list and were able to get that to render on our page after some struggling. We then decided to split up and work in pairs. Anri and I worked on the Navigation sidebar which will be used to display our trips. We spent a great deal of time working on this and eventually got it to work after about two hours of debugging. We are now able to end the week on a good note after solving a difficult problem. Cheers.

   - Today we were working on the front end authentication again. This is a vey challenging piece to the project for our group. We eventually got the login, logout, and signup functionality to work from a front end perspective. However we also started setting up a trips list but ran into issues with authentication. When we were logged in we had issues with retrieving the trips due to an issue sending the token to the backend. We were not able to finish this piece and will start back on it tomorrow.

1. 2/22/2022

   - Today we finished up the backend routes. We start up on the front end authentication and ran into some road blocks here. We spent a lot of time setting up files and calls to the backend and were able to make a bit of progress. We got a front end login page up and running but we still need to work on getting the token piece to transfer between the front and back end.

1. 2/21/2022

   - Today we made some solid progress on the endpoints for backend. We managed to get our Get One, Update, and Delete functions working for Trips. This spring-boarded us to also be able to complete the Events endpoints as well by connecting then to the trips. We tested all the endpoints and everything seems to be working the way we expected. We are almost done with out backend and only have a few more endpoints to figure out.

1. 2/16/2022

   - Today we go held up significantly on creating out endpoints. We spent many hours trying to figure out how to make the Update function but were not able to get it to work after much effort. We made a plan to ask for more help next week so we do not get bogged down so much.

1. 2/15/2022

   - Today we made a tremendous amount of progress on the external Google API calls. In our group as a team we did a lot of testing to gather all of the data we want and to get it in the form we want for our database. This involved creating a search function and gathering, name, address, photos, and location latitude and longitude. These will later be used in our front end to display information on the trip locations.

1. 2/14/2023

   - We started the day working on authentication. This has been a challenging part of the project for our group. We ran into a few roadblocks but ultimately were able to get the login/logout/singup functions working. Authentication has been comleted. We can now also use the FastAPI frontend to test these authentification routes.

1. 2/13/2023

   - Today we spent some time working on authentification for our project. This involved working with working with JWTdown for FastAIP. We worked through some of the documentation and started setting up the login logout signup functionality for our project.

1. 2/10/2023

   - Today we spent some time working with out external API, Google Maps. We dug through some of the data offered by the api and mapped out exactly what we wanted to get from it.

1. 2/9/2023
   - Today we finished up doing the wire frame work for our project. We also started designing out API framework. This involved mapping out the different web pages of our project and figuring out what needs to be done. Then in markup files we drew out exactly what data we need and expect to get from each endpoint.
