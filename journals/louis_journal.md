   - Today we finished up the backend routes.  We start up on the front end authentication and ran into some road blocks here.  We spent a lot of time setting up files and calls to the backend and were able to make a bit of progress.  We got a front end login page up and running but we still need to work on getting the token piece to transfer between the front and back end.

   - Today we made some solid progress on the endpoints for backend. We managed to get our Get One, Update, and Delete functions working for Trips. This springboarded us to also be able to complete the Events endpoints as well by connecting then to the trips. We tested all the endpoints and everything seems to be working the way we expected. We are almost done with out backend and only have a few more endpoints to figure out.

   - Today we go held up significantly on creating out endpoints. We spent many hours trying to figure out how to make the Update function but were not able to get it to work after much effort. We made a plan to ask for more help next week so we do not get bogged down so much.

   - Today we made a tremendous amount of progress on the external Google API calls. In our group as a team we did a lot of testing to gather all of the data we want and to get it in the form we want for our database. This involved creating a search function and gathering, name, address, photos, and location latitude and longitude. These will later be used in our front end to display information on the trip locations.

    - We started the day working on authentication. This has been a challenging part of the project for our group. We ran into a few roadblocks but ultimately were able to get the login/logout/singup functions working. Authentication has been comleted. We can now also use the FastAPI frontend to test these authentification routes.

    - Today we spent some time working on authentification for our project. This involed working with working with JWTdown for FastAIP. We worked through some of the documentation and started setting up the login logout signup functionality for our project.

    - Today we spent some time working with out external API, Google Maps. We dug through some of the data offered by the api and mapped out exactly what we wanted to get from it.

    - Today we finished up doing the wire frame work for our project. We also started designing out API framework. This involved mapping out the different web pages of our project and figuring out what needs to be done. Then in markup files we drew out exactly what data we need and expect to get from each endpoint.
