    - Today we made a tremendous amount of progress on the external Google API calls.  In our group as a team we did a lot of testing to gather all of the data we want and to get it in the form we want for our database.  This involved creating a search function and gathering, name, address, photos, and location latitude and longitude.  These will later be used in our front end to display information on the trip locations.

    - We started the day working on authentication.  This has been a challenging part of the project for our group.  We ran into a few roadblocks but ultimately were able to get the login/logout/singup functions working.  Authentication has been comleted. We can now also use the FastAPI frontend to test these authentification routes.

    - Today we finished up doing the wire frame work for our project.  We also started designing out API framework.  This involved mapping out the different web pages of our project and figuring out what needs to be done.  Then in markup files we drew out exactly what data we need and expect to get from each endpoint.
