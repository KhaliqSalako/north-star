   - We finalized the project today by working through a series of minor bug fixes. We got the photo carosel working on the login page and worked through the linter. The code us fully ready to be graded with all bugs fixed and no red in the console. All features are working well.

1. 3/8/2022

   - Mostly finished with the project but just continued cleaning up a few errors, and fine tuning the styling. We are mostly working on adding photos to the website and formatting them on the pages. The project is almost complete and we should be done by tomorrow.

1. 3/7/2022

   - We are at the point in the project where we are working on styling and bug fixing. We set up the forms the way we wanted to and were working on divising containers for our main page. We also discussed adding some error handling to the code which we hope to implement tomorrow.

1. 3/6/2022

   - At this point, the functionality on our website is essentially complete. We broke up into pairs today and Braden and I finished up the signup and login modals. The rest of the day was spent working on styling. We got the main cards styled in a nice manner and we also got hte background for the main page and trips page working.

   - Today we had a tough day because we could not get our nav bar working. We also could not get our login modal working. We spent the whole day on these and did not make any progress. It was very frustrating. Luckily we came up with a plan that could potentially get us through this difficult challenge on monday.

   - Today we made a good amount of progress by first finishing up out Google API map views for both the itinerary page with multiple pins and the events page with one pin for each event. We then split up and Braden and I set up the Trip cards on the main home page. We got the photos and functionality working for the cards and it looks great.

   Our seige on the google map api seems to coming te the final hour. We have tunnelled mostly under it's walls but were unable to make a complete breakthrough. Splitting off into pairs again

   We decimated our milestones today, smashing bugs in a wild berserker rage. With the pests defeated we moved on to integrate google search functionality. Braden of House Towns proved a competant ally on this campaign.

   Working with the Town today we received many fortunate successes. We created our blessed forms that will become the foundation for our project to come. In my wisdom I showed how to conditionally render the dropdown in a elegant and scalable way. I did not tell the other's I saw the code in a dream the night before. They would not understand.


2/27/2022
   Pairs again today. Working with Loui the IV of the kingdom of Paparella. Going deep into the the debugging abyss under a mountain of stack overflow pages. Or efforts seemed fruitless and we lost morale. Luckily the other pair seemed to fair better. 

2/24/2022
   We have started to split into pairs. Today I worked with louis. We spent time working on a kind of nav side bar for the trips. It was a pained struggle that almost cost me my sanity. I still hear whispers in my brain, and red console behind my eyelids. But afterwords their was joyous celebration and much jubilation that made it all worth it.

   Frontend authentication is back and badder than ever. We eventually slayed that beast and got login, logout-- all the good stuff working. Then came the trip list and we struggled to send the token or some kind of cookie to the back end. 

2/22/2022
   Finishing the backend we started to work on the front end authentication, this proved to difficult. Trying to understand what we had to do was confusing and we didn't really understand what those functions were doing. We did make some progress an the front end.

2/21/2022
   After getting some help we started to make significant progress on the backend part of the code. We tested all our endpoint in swagger we proved to be pretty easy. We are very close to finishing our endpoints.

2/16/2022
   Making these backend endpoints with fast api hav proven difficult. We were thinking of getting help tomorrow.

2/15/2022
 We spent a lot of time and made a lot of progress setting up google map api calls. It was difficult to understand the syntax they wanted but then progress became much faster.

2/14/2023
   Started authentication lead to some roadblocks and we spent a significant amount of time. This has been a challenging part of the project for our group. Despite this we were able to successfully set up our authentication with the database. 

2/13/2023
   We worked on our docker files and our requirements.txt. We started the authentication. We ran into an issue with getting the account endpoints to appear on the website. We analyzed some example code that we had for mongo project. Ultimately it was not very helpful. We were thinking about asking Riley tomorrow.We talked about if we are going to use a relational database or an non relational one. We ended up choosing Mongo for our DB of choice for the project since it is going to be a small project with little metadata needed. We also spent some time today Reviewing API documentation, as well as watching the first set of videos in Learn that talk about FastAPI.

2/10/2023

   Today we finished our API endpoints. We alo reviewed some documentation. not much was done. 

 2/9/2023
    Today we finished up doing the wire frame work for our project. Today we worked on our API endpoints. We were able to finish all of the end points for the most part. This involved drawing out web-pages of our project. We also made our markup files were we drew out exactly what data we need and expect to get from each endpoint.
