Today we worked on our docker-compose files as well as our requirements.txt file. We were able to get our docker containers up and running, as well as going to the localhost:8000/docs. We began working through the authentication video, and were following along with it. We ran into an issue with getting the account endpoints to appear on the website. We started going through some example code that we had for mongo projects, and it was not very helpful. We will be seeking assistance from an instructor tomorrow.

Today we finished our API endpoints. We also started discussing the pro's and con's of using SQL vs. Mongo for our DB of choice for the project. We also spent some time today Reviewing API documentation, as well as watching the first set of videos in Learn that talk about FastAPI.

Today we worked on our API endpoints. We were able to finish all of the end points for the most part. We did some research into our Google maps API, and what kind of calls we would be making to it. We also did some small revisions of wireframing because we noticed a few features were missing.
