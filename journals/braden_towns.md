### 3/2/2023

Today was very productive again. We were able to create a map with all of our event locations on it. We were also able to center that map based on the average lat and long of our coordinates. After we finished that portion of the project we had a team discussion about implementing a calendar on the front end, and decided that it was ultimately going to be too difficult for the scope of this project. We instead opted to show our trips in the form of cards. Louis and I split into pair programming and we were able to successfully implement the trip cards with all appropriate functionality. We ended the day trying to do some formatting for the cards with bootstrap and css, and will need to continue troubleshooting that tomorrow.

### 3/1/2023

Today was yet again another really productive day for our group. We were able to implement our location API functionality the creation and editing of events. We were also able to embed a photo using our location api. Finally we were able to create a small map on our event page with a marker of the location of the event on it. We will work tomorrow to implement a map with all of the locations of all the events for a given day.

### 2/28/2023

Today was a very productive day for our group. We were able to make a functioning delete, update, create, and view page for our events. This was done by working in pair programming. I worked with Anri today. With those functions now implemented, our project meets the basic functionality requirements for forms and pages in our project. We also were able to implement a side nav bar with drop down menu's for each trip.

### 2/27/2023

Today we had a lot of struggles as a group. We were able to write 2 functioning unit tests at the beginning of the day. We then split into some pair programming. I worked with Khaliq and we were able to make a functioning delete button on the front end. We then started to work on an edit form and decided that we needed to be able to simply view one trip before we can edit it. It took a long time in the afternoon, and we had to ask several questions to instructors, but we were finally able to round off the day with a functioning "View One Trip" page.

### 2/24/2023

We started today off strong. Today we were able to display all of the trips associated with an account. We then decided that it might be a good idea to split into pairs to work on different aspects of the front end. I worked with Khaliq on trying to create a new trip on the front end. We ran into errors stating that we didn't have authorization to do this. We decided that the problem must be something to do with the token. We were unable to solve this today and will be asking for help on Monday.


### 2/23/2023

Today we were able to get a functioning log in, log out, and sign up button on the front end. We ran into a blocker that we were unable to resolve in regards to listing all of our trips. We first had an issue with authentication, which was resolved, but then we still had an issue with our trips being displayed. We will have to ask for more help with this matter tomorrow.

### 2/22/2023

Today we started on front end authentication. We ran into some blockers as far as understanding how to apply the code that is in the cookbook. After asking for help, we were finally able to fix our errors. We got a very barebones login form made, and will be attempting to get it to work tomorrow.

### 2/21/2023

Today was a very productive day. We started out with a roadblock on getting a single trip. We were able to overcome that, and then proceeded to complete all of our other API endpoints. We can now successfully create, list all, list one, update, and delete a trip and event. The events are also only visible for the trip that they are associated with. Tomorrow we are going to be working on implementing our location API call into the event "location" field.

### 2/15/2023

Today we set up our external API through google maps. We wrote the function that will allow us to search for a location, and then retrieve various data into a json object. This was tough to get started on, but once we understood the format that the api wanted, it was much easier to pick and choose the points of data that we wanted to use. We also created an api_keys file that we put the google maps api key inside of. We added this file to the gitignore.

### 2/14/2023

Today we were able to successfully set up our authentication with the database. We have chosen MongoDB as our DB. We are able to create a user as well as log them in and out. We are also able to view the token generated for the user. It was difficult working through this problem, but we were able to do it by reverse engineering some code that we had from another functional project.

### 2/13/2023

Today we worked on our docker-compose files as well as our requirements.txt file. We were able to get our docker containers up and running, as well as going to the localhost:8000/docs. We began working through the authentication video, and were following along with it. We ran into an issue with getting the account endpoints to appear on the website. We started going through some example code that we had for mongo projects, and it was not very helpful. We will be seeking assistance from an instructor tomorrow.

### 2/10/2023

Today we finished our API endpoints. We also started discussing the pro's and con's of using SQL vs. Mongo for our DB of choice for the project. We also spent some time today Reviewing API documentation, as well as watching the first set of videos in Learn that talk about FastAPI.

### 2/9/2023

Today we worked on our API endpoints. We were able to finish all of the end points for the most part. We did some research into our Google maps API, and what kind of calls we would be making to it. We also did some small revisions of wireframing because we noticed a few features were missing.
