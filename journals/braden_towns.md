### 2/22/2023

Today we started on front end authentication. We ran into some blockers as far as understanding how to apply the code that is in the cookbook. After asking for help, we were finally able to fix our errors. We got a very barebones login form made, and will be attempting to get it to work tomorrow.

### 2/21/2023

Today was a very productive day. We started out with a roadblock on getting a single trip. We were able to overcome that, and then proceeded to complete all of our other API endpoints. We can now successfully create, list all, list one, update, and delete a trip and event. The events are also only visible for the trip that they are associated with. Tomorrow we are going to be working on implementing our location API call into the event "location" field.

### 2/15/2023

Today we set up our external API through google maps. We wrote the function that will allow us to search for a location, and then retrieve various data into a json object. This was tough to get started on, but once we understood the format that the api wanted, it was much easier to pick and choose the points of data that we wanted to use. We also created an api_keys file that we put the google maps api key inside of. We added this file to the gitignore.

### 2/14/2023

Today we were able to successfully set up our authentication with the database. We have chosen MongoDB as our DB. We are able to create a user as well as log them in and out. We are also able to view the token generated for the user. It was difficult working through this problem, but we were able to do it by reverse engineering some code that we had from another functional project.

### 2/13/2023

Today we worked on our docker-compose files as well as our requirements.txt file. We were able to get our docker containers up and running, as well as going to the localhost:8000/docs. We began working through the authentication video, and were following along with it. We ran into an issue with getting the account endpoints to appear on the website. We started going through some example code that we had for mongo projects, and it was not very helpful. We will be seeking assistance from an instructor tomorrow.

### 2/10/2023

Today we finished our API endpoints. We also started discussing the pro's and con's of using SQL vs. Mongo for our DB of choice for the project. We also spent some time today Reviewing API documentation, as well as watching the first set of videos in Learn that talk about FastAPI.

### 2/9/2023

Today we worked on our API endpoints. We were able to finish all of the end points for the most part. We did some research into our Google maps API, and what kind of calls we would be making to it. We also did some small revisions of wireframing because we noticed a few features were missing.
